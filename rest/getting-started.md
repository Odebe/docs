# Getting started

To add the Onyx::REST functionality into your application, you must explicitly add the `onyx-rest` dependency into your `shard.yml` file along with `onyx`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx:
    github: onyxframework/onyx
    version: ~> 0.1.0
  onyx-rest:
    github: onyxframework/rest
    version: ~> 0.6.0
```

Then in your Crystal code you should add the following line:

```crystal
require "onyx/rest"
```

Now you're ready to create your first Action-View based JSON endpoint!

```crystal
# TODO:
```
